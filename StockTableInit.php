##I'm envisioning this as the script that will set up the database and tables
/* To Group:
 * probably doesnt NEED to be a script but this way everyone can see how to connect to the amazon
 * database and we have a clean record of the way that the tables were originally set up
 * in the future we can just make changes to the sql database directly but try to make a similar script when creating tables etc.
